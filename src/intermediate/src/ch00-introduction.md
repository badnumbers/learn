# Introduction

SuperCollider has a reputation for being hard to learn, and it's hard to
dispute why. But if you're interested in modular synthesis using code, you're
probably not intimidated by programming. So if you'd consider yourself an
intermediate to advanced programmer, this book is for you.

This book doesn't entirely replace the beginner one, but rather supplements it
with heavier technical details that will (hopefully) be interesting to you.
It will move a lot quicker through programming basics.
